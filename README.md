## About My_Resume
This project was created as a way to practice my skills in Vue, which I recently learned. While building the application, I realized that it would be great to have a place where I could bring my ideas to life while learning the entire deployment process. With this in mind, I completed this simple project with the goal of deploying it to production.
- Backend: Laravel Breeze
- Frontend: Vue.js, Tailwind 
- DB: MySQL,
- SMTP: Google

## Features
- Fully responsive design,
- User authentication from Breeze (registration disabled)
- Simple CMS for content editing,
- Contact form (raw mail).
